Usage
------------------
* Highlight: Select "Edit > Highlight Words > Highlight Words" and enter the words (separated by whitespace)
* Unhighlight: Select "Edit > Highlight Words > Unhighlight Words"
* Toggle Settings: Select "Edit > Highlight Words > Toggle Settings"
* Edit settings file: Select "Preferences" > "Package Settings" > "HighlightWords", copy settings from default to user, and edit settings file. Available settings are:
 - "colors_by_scope": Change the highlight colors.
 - "permanent_highlight_keyword_color_mappings": Define always highlighted keywords with specified colors, such as "TODO" or "FIXIT". The optional "flag" parameter may be 0 (regex), 1 (literal), 2 (regex and ignore case) or 3 (literal and ignore case).
* Perl-style regular expression patterns are accepted.
  For example,
  to highlight "fix a bug" but not "prefix with",
  the expression could be "\\bfix .\*\\b".
* You can create a regex search targeting the words you want to match with `/regex/`.
  For example,
  if you enter `/(?: => )([^\s]+)/ word1` on the panel,
  it will highlight all the words matched by the regex `([^\s]+)` plus the `word1`.

Note: These commands are also available in Command Panel with prefix "**HighlightWords:**"

How to find color scope
------------------
  * Open the file that has some color you want (e.g open C++ which have green strings)
  * Select the word that has colour you want to use

  ![selection](doc_images/selection.png)
  * Open console (ctrl+~ (tilde))
  * Paste `view.scope_name(view.sel()[0].begin())` and press `ENTER`
  * Copy returned string, for mine selection it is `source.c++ meta.function.c meta.block.c storage.type.c`
  * Paste this string inside color property:

  ![highlight](doc_images/highlight.png)

  **Color will change after you re-enter the tab**
